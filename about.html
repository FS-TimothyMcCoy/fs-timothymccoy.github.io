<p>About me</p>
<h1>Timothy McCoy</h1>
<p>I am a freelance Web Designer from Charleston, South Carolina with 2 years of experience and going. I love team-oriented projects and I am a natural leader that always enjoys a healthy team environment. During my senior year in high school, I started learning about HTML and CSS through a mixture of the coding class I was in and a website I was referred to called codeacademy. After diving into codeacady's extensive lessons I learned quite a lot of things that not only helped me breeze through the class but also allowed me to help others in my class struggling with the material. After I graduated high school, I worked for a year full time then started preparing to attend Full Sail University.<br><br>Upon attending Full Sail I started learning way more about my industry and many new tips and tricks I had never heard of. Since the industry is always changing I came to find out that many of the things I learned in high school were old practice or outdated. That only encouraged me to learn new things and pick up the tricks of the trade as many call it.</p>
